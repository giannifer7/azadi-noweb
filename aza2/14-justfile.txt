I'll create a basic justfile tailored for your Rust project with common tasks:

<[@file justfile]>=
# List all recipes
default:
    @just --list

# Format code
fmt:
    cargo fmt

# Check formatting
fmt-check:
    cargo fmt --check

# Run clippy lints
lint:
    cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run tests
test:
    cargo test

# Build in release mode
build:
    cargo build --release

# Create all packages
package: (rpm) (deb)
    @echo "All packages created"

# Create RPM package
rpm:
    cargo rpm build

# Create DEB package
deb:
    cargo deb

# Clean all build artifacts
clean:
    cargo clean
    rm -rf target/

# Update dependencies
update:
    cargo update

# Development build with file watching
watch:
    cargo watch -x check -x test

# Install all required cargo tools
setup:
    cargo install cargo-rpm cargo-deb cargo-watch

# Run basic checks before commit
pre-commit: fmt lint test
    @echo "All pre-commit checks passed!"

# Generate and upload packages to cache
cache: build
    nix-build
    cachix push azadi-noweb result
$$

This justfile includes:
1. Basic development tasks (fmt, lint, test)
2. Package building tasks (rpm, deb)
3. Cache management
4. Helper tasks (clean, update)
5. A pre-commit check sequence

You can run any task with `just <taskname>`, for example:
```bash
just fmt        # Format code
just test       # Run tests
just package    # Build all packages
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more specific tasks?
2. Add documentation for each task?
3. Add configuration options to any tasks?
