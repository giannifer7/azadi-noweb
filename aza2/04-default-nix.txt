Ah, I see the issue. The version extraction is failing. Let's fix the default.nix by using a simpler approach:

<[@file default.nix]>=
# default.nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.rustPlatform.buildRustPackage rec {
  pname = "azadi-noweb";
  version = "0.1.2";  # This should match your Cargo.toml

  src = ./.;

  cargoLock = {
    lockFile = ./Cargo.lock;
  };

  meta = with pkgs.lib; {
    description = "A Rust implementation of noweb-style literate programming tool";
    homepage = "https://github.com/giannifer7/azadi-noweb";
    license = licenses.mit;
    maintainers = with maintainers; [ giannifer7 ];
    mainProgram = "azadi-noweb";
  };
}
$$

The main changes are:
1. Removed the complex version extraction
2. Hardcoded the version (it should match your Cargo.toml)
3. Simplified the overall structure

This should work better with Cachix's test workflow. We can add automatic version extraction later as a separate improvement once we have the basic CI working.

Would you like me to:
1. Show how to add automatic version extraction in a safer way?
2. Add more build configuration options?
3. Improve the error handling?
