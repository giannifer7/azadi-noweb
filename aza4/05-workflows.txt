# GitHub Actions workflow configurations

Let's start with the Debian package workflow:

<[debian_workflow_steps]>=
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - name: Build package
        run: |
          docker-compose -f packaging/scripts/docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm debian-build

      - name: Test package
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo dpkg -i packaging/build/deb/*.deb
          azadi-noweb --version
          azadi-noweb --help
$$

<[@file .github/workflows/packages-debian.yml]>=
# .github/workflows/packages-debian.yml
name: Build Debian Package

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      version:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Download package files
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: package-files
          path: packaging/build

<[debian_workflow_steps]>

      - name: Upload package
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: debian-package
          path: packaging/build/deb/*.deb
$$

And update the release workflow to include Debian:

<[@file .github/workflows/packages-release.yml additions]>=
# .github/workflows/packages-release.yml additions
  debian:
    needs: generate
    uses: ./.github/workflows/packages-debian.yml
    with:
      version: ${{ needs.generate.outputs.version }}

  release:
    needs: [generate, alpine, arch, void, debian]  # Added debian to needs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          path: artifacts

      - name: Create Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          files: |
            artifacts/alpine-package/*
            artifacts/arch-package/*
            artifacts/void-glibc-package/*
            artifacts/void-musl-package/*
            artifacts/debian-package/*  # Added debian packages
          generate_release_notes: true
