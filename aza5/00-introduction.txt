# Introduction to the package generation system

This system generates and builds packages for multiple Linux distributions while keeping
the base Cargo.toml clean for Nix builds. The design follows these principles:
- Single source of truth for package metadata
- Distribution-specific configuration in separate files
- Clean separation between generation and building
- Type-safe implementation

<[intro_overview]>=
The system consists of these main components:
1. A Python package generator using templates
2. Docker-based build environments
3. GitHub Actions workflows for automation
4. Distribution-specific templates
